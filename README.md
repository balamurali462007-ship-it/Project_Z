# Project Z  
### Protecting trust in the age of AI

Project Z is an AI-powered system designed to help users identify scams and malicious content in real time.  
As AI-generated messages, images, voices, and videos become more realistic, Project Z acts as a protective layer that alerts users before trust, data, or money is lost.

## The Problem
Modern scams use AI to appear authentic and convincing. Traditional security tools are often slow or limited to one type of content.

## Our Solution
Project Z uses advanced AI to analyze text, links, images, audio, and video to detect suspicious or AI-generated content and warn users instantly.
